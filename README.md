## PhoneBook-Study

A very simple Phone Book app developed in Portuguese that allows the user to save and edit contacts containing 
their name, phone number and email adress.

### About the app

This app was developed during my studies in Java development for Android.
Since this is only for showcase, this app eventually will get improved as far as my java studies goes on. 


>**My goals with this project was to:**
>- To develop and improve Activity workflow and simple layouts.
>- Work with simple life cycle callbacks.
>- Work with DAO class in order to get acess to the app data source.
